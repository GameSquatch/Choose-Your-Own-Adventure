    ***************** INSTRUCTIONS *****************
    ENTER NOTHING FOR YOUR FIRST TIME PLAYING. The
        question will be displayed, and then you can
        enter 'a' or 'b' (without quote ticks) to
        begin making your decisions.
 
    AFTER YOUR FIRST DECISION: There will be a code
    That you then enter with your a or b input. This
    will continue your game where you left off.
    ***************** ************ *****************
 
 Description:
    I was inspired by the Netflix tv show, Black Mirror.
    They debuted a new episode that let you choose your
    way through the scenes. It was also about a kid who
    was making a choose-your-own-adventure game. This
    is my attempt on the SoloLearn platform. Everything
    is completely original, including the story, so I
    can't promise it will be good.
