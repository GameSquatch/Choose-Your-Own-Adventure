***************** INSTRUCTIONS *****************
ENTER NOTHING FOR YOUR FIRST TIME PLAYING. The
question will be displayed, and then you can
enter 'a' or 'b' (without quote ticks) to
begin making your decisions.

AFTER YOUR FIRST DECISION: There will be a code
That you then enter with your a or b input. This
will continue your game where you left off.

First Run: enter nothing

Second Run:
Line One: choice for last run question
Line Two: nothing

Third and above run:
Line One: choice for last run question
Line Two: code from last run
***************** ************ *****************

Description:
I was inspired by the Netflix tv show, Black Mirror.
They debuted a new episode that let you choose your
way through the scenes. It was also about a kid who
was making a choose-your-own-adventure game. This
is my attempt on the SoloLearn platform. Everything
is completely original, including the story, so I
can't promise it will be good.

This is a work in progress. Every new layer of choices
doubles in size from the previous layer, so story
making takes a lot time. Like and comment if you
so choose. I might be so inclined to make more
choices.
